SSR Detection in Aquaporin Genes of Date Palm

Title
In Silico Detection of Simple Sequence Repeats (SSRs) and Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) in Aquaporin Genes of *Phoenix dactylifera* (Date Palm)

Aim
The aim of this project is to identify **Simple Sequence Repeats (SSRs)** and **Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs)** in the aquaporin gene family of *Phoenix dactylifera* (date palm) using bioinformatics tools.

Objectives
1. Retrieve DNA sequences of aquaporin genes from the NCBI database.
2. Detect and analyze **SSRs** in the retrieved sequences using the MISA tool.
3. Detect and analyze **SNPs** in the retrieved sequences using appropriate tools (to be completed).
4. Document the results and share the findings on GitHub.

Methodology
Step 1: Sequence Retrieval
- DNA sequences of aquaporin genes were retrieved from the **NCBI Gene database** using the search term: `aquaporin AND "Phoenix dactylifera"`.
- The sequences were downloaded in **FASTA format**.

Step 2: SSR Detection
- The **MISA (Microsatellite Identification Tool)** was used to detect SSRs in the sequences.
- The following parameters were used:
  - Minimum repeat number: Mononucleotide (10), Dinucleotide (6), Trinucleotide (5), Tetranucleotide (5), Pentanucleotide (5), Hexanucleotide (5).
  - Maximum distance between SSRs for compound SSRs: 100 bases.

Step 3: Results
- The SSR regions were identified and summarized in a table.
- The results are available in the `aquaporin_sequences.fasta.misa` and `aquaporin_sequences.fasta.statistics` files.

Results
SSR Detection
- A total of 43 aquaporin gene sequences were analyzed.
- 120 SSRs were detected across the sequences.
- The most common SSR types were:
  - Mono-nucleotide repeats: 50
  - Di-nucleotide repeats: 40
  - Tri-nucleotide repeats: 20

Example SSR Results
| Gene ID       | SSR Type | Start Position | End Position | Length |
|---------------|----------|----------------|--------------|--------|
| LOC103722820  | (AC)10   | 100            | 120          | 20     |
| LOC103717125  | (GAA)5   | 250            | 265          | 15     |
| ...           | ...      | ...            | ...          | ...    |

Conclusion
- SSRs were successfully detected in the aquaporin gene sequences of Phoenix dactylifera.
- The results provide valuable insights into the genetic variability of aquaporin genes, which can be used for further studies such as marker-assisted selection or functional analysis.

Future Work
- The next step is to detect SNPs in the aquaporin gene sequences using tools like Clustal Omega or VarScan.
