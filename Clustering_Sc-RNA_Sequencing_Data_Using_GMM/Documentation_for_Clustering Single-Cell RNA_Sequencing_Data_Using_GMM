Clustering Single-Cell RNA Sequencing Data Using Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM)

1. Project Statement
Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) has revolutionized our understanding of cellular heterogeneity by enabling the profiling of gene expression at the single-cell level. However, analyzing scRNA-seq data is challenging due to its high dimensionality, noise, and the presence of distinct cell subpopulations. Clustering is a critical step in scRNA-seq analysis, as it helps identify distinct cell types or states. Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs) are a powerful probabilistic clustering method that can model complex data distributions and provide soft assignments of cells to clusters. In this project, we apply GMMs to cluster scRNA-seq data and identify distinct cell populations.

2. Objective
The objective of this project is to:

Apply Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs) to cluster single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data.

Identify distinct cell populations (e.g., cell types or states) based on gene expression profiles.

Annotate clusters using known marker genes to assign biological meaning to the identified cell populations.

3. Aim
The aim of this project is to:

Preprocess scRNA-seq data (normalization, dimensionality reduction).

Cluster the data using GMMs and determine the optimal number of clusters.

Identify marker genes for each cluster.

Annotate clusters based on known cell type markers.

Visualize the results to interpret the biological significance of the clusters.

4. Methodology
4.1 Data Preprocessing
Dataset: The PBMC (Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cells) dataset from 10x Genomics was used, which contains ~2,700 cells and ~27,000 genes.

Normalization: The data was normalized to 10,000 counts per cell to account for differences in sequencing depth.

Log Transformation: The data was log-transformed to stabilize the variance of gene expression.

Highly Variable Genes: Genes with high variability across cells were selected to focus on the most informative genes.

Scaling: The data was scaled to zero mean and unit variance to ensure equal contribution from all genes.

4.2 Dimensionality Reduction
Principal Component Analysis (PCA): PCA was applied to reduce the dimensionality of the data to 50 principal components, making it computationally efficient for clustering.

4.3 Clustering Using Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs)
Model Fitting: A Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) was fitted to the reduced-dimensional data.

Optimal Number of Clusters: The Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) was used to determine the optimal number of clusters.

Cluster Assignments: Each cell was assigned to a cluster based on the highest posterior probability.

4.4 Marker Gene Identification
Wilcoxon Rank-Sum Test: Marker genes for each cluster were identified using the Wilcoxon rank-sum test, which compares gene expression between clusters.

Top Marker Genes: The top 5 marker genes for each cluster were extracted.

4.5 Cluster Annotation
Known Marker Genes: Clusters were annotated using known marker genes for PBMC cell types (e.g., CD4 for T cells, CD14 for monocytes).

Default Labels: Clusters without matching marker genes were labeled as "Unknown".

4.6 Visualization
UMAP: Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP) was used to visualize the clusters in 2D space.

Annotated Clusters: The UMAP plot was annotated with cell type labels.

5. Results
5.1 Clustering Results
The GMM identified 8 distinct clusters in the PBMC dataset.

The optimal number of clusters was determined using the Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC).

5.2 Marker Genes
The top marker genes for each cluster were identified. For example:

Cluster 0: NKG7, GZMB, PRF1 (associated with NK cells and cytotoxic T cells).

Cluster 3: HLA-DRB1, HLA-DQA1, HLA-DPB1 (associated with B cells and dendritic cells).

Cluster 4: LST1, FCER1G, AIF1 (associated with monocytes and macrophages).

5.3 Cluster Annotations
Clusters were annotated based on known marker genes:

Cluster 0: NK cells

Cluster 1: Cytotoxic T cells

Cluster 3: B cells

Cluster 4: Monocytes

Cluster 5: T cells

Cluster 6: B cells

Cluster 7: Monocytes / Dendritic cells

Cluster 2: Mixed population (labeled as "Unknown")

5.4 Visualization
A UMAP plot was generated to visualize the clusters. Each cluster was color-coded and annotated with its assigned cell type.

6. Conclusion
The Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) successfully clustered the PBMC dataset into distinct cell populations.

Marker genes were identified for each cluster, and clusters were annotated using known cell type markers.

The results are consistent with known PBMC cell types, demonstrating the effectiveness of GMMs for scRNA-seq data analysis.

7. Future Work
Refine Annotations: Use additional marker genes or literature to refine cluster annotations.

Compare with Other Methods: Compare GMM results with other clustering methods (e.g., K-means, hierarchical clustering).

Larger Datasets: Apply GMMs to larger scRNA-seq datasets to test scalability.

Integration with Other Omics Data: Integrate scRNA-seq data with other omics data (e.g., proteomics, epigenomics) for a more comprehensive analysis.
