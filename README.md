# 5. Smith-Waterman Algorithm Implementation  

[Project 5: Smith-Waterman Algorithm Implementation](https://github.com/Jeyarish-007/Bioinformatics_Projects/tree/main/Smith-Waterman_Algorithm)

A Python implementation of the Smith-Waterman algorithm for local sequence alignment.  
  
## Overview  
  
The Smith-Waterman algorithm is designed to find the optimal local alignment between two biological sequences (DNA, RNA, or proteins). Unlike global alignment (Needleman-Wunsch), it identifies highly similar subsequences even if the overall sequences are divergent.  
  
## Objectives  
  
- Compute the best local alignment between two sequences  
- Identify conserved regions (e.g., protein domains or gene segments)  
- Provide a scoring system for matches, mismatches, and gaps  
- Serve as a foundation for understanding more complex alignment tools  
  
## Algorithm Details  
  
### Steps  
1. **Initialization**:  
   - Create a scoring matrix of size (m+1) Ã— (n+1) (where m and n are sequence lengths)  
   - Initialize the first row and column to 0 (local alignment allows alignment to start anywhere)  
  
2. **Matrix Filling**:  
   - For each cell, calculate the maximum score from:  
     - 0 (to ensure local alignment)  
     - Diagonal cell + match/mismatch score  
     - Upper cell + gap penalty  
     - Left cell + gap penalty  
  
3. **Traceback**:  
   - Start from the highest-scoring cell  
   - Move diagonally (match/mismatch), up (gap in sequence 2), or left (gap in sequence 1) until reaching 0  
  
### Scoring System  
- Match: +2 (default)  
- Mismatch: -1 (default)  
- Gap penalty: -1 (default)  
  
## Implementation  
  
The algorithm is implemented in Python with the following features:  
- Dynamic programming approach  
- Customizable scoring parameters  
- Traceback for alignment visualization  
- Example usage with sample sequences  
  
## Files  
- `Smith-waterman_algorithm.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook with the implementation and example  
  
## Usage  
  
```python  
# Example usage  [header-7](#header-7)
seq1 = "ACCTA"  
seq2 = "AGCTA"  
      
aligned_seq1, aligned_seq2, score = smith_waterman(seq1, seq2)  
      
print(f"Sequence 1: {aligned_seq1}")  
print(f"Sequence 2: {aligned_seq2}")  
print(f"Alignment Score: {score}")
```
